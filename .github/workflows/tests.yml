      # Cache the installation of Poetry itself, e.g. the next step. This prevents the workflow
      # from installing Poetry every time, which can be slow. Note the use of the Poetry version
      # number in the cache key, and the "-0" suffix: this allows you to invalidate the cache
      # manually if/when you want to upgrade Poetry, or if something goes wrong. This could be
      # mildly cleaner by using an environment variable, but I don't really care.

      # Now install _your_ project. This isn't necessary for many types of projects -- particularly
      # things like Django apps don't need this. But it's a good idea since it fully-exercises the

      # they'll be installed and working.
